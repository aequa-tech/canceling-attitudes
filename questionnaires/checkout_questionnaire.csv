"What opinion do you have about the topic of ""social media shaming"" after the annotation?",How did you find the annotation task? (difficult? emotionally impactful? etc.),Is there anything you would have liked to add?,Is there anything you would have liked to change?,Did the moral questionnaire influence the way you performed the annotation?,Did you perceived the completion of the questionnaire and the annotation as thematically related?,How would you use a tool that can recognize social media shaming?
I don't agree with it,interesting,no,no,no,yes,to make social media a safer place for everyone
It should always be condemned ,Challenging for my emotional side,No,No,I tried not to but yes,Yes,For further research 
I think that social media shaming is bad and another name for cyberbullying.,"sometimes i could not understand the comments that were given because of spelling mistakes, so it was hard to choose a category.","the possibility to filter comments before annotating them, to erase the comments that are incomprehensible","no, but i think it could be useful to not distinguish between the celebrity and the context: if the comment is hateful, it should be considered as an attack and it should be removed from platforms anyways",no,no,"i would use it to erase comments that are hateful on social media platforms, to stop social media shaming"
I believe some people abuse social media for gratuite shaming,it depended on my opinion about the topic ,no,I believe some comments were useless,no,yes I did,To prevent bullying (particularly in young people) and filter information
I it is very bad and that it could really hurt the people affected ,At times a bit difficult to understand what the comments meant (ex. sarcasm),No,"Maybe a little more filtering on the comments, some were quite confusing",No,There could be some similarities in the annotation task between people who answered to the questionnaire in a similar way,To report haters
The same as before,"A bit difficult when comments contain errors, slang and references to local debates","No, there aren't","No, there aren't","No, it didn't","Yes, I do",I would use it to filter and hide shaming comments
"There are actually different forms of ""social media shaming"" and the words of people really count a lot even if they haven't thought about it could hurt others that much when they were writing them.",It was actually really interesting,"Sometimes I wasn't quite sure about which emotions have certain comments like they may be sensitive to other subjects but not for the target subject, so I'm not sure even if it's defending the target subject it still may be offensive to others",No,"Yes, after completing the questionnaire I tended to give a second thought for the annotation","Yes, I do think so",I'll apply it to social medias and warn people when their comments may be a social media shaming 
"it's an important tool to be able to recognise and distinguish the different types of texts that contain hateful, shaming and offensive expressions, in order to study and store the evolution of speech on social media.","It has a certain impact on the reader to see how certain expressions and words are used freely, most of the time to attack and shame people who are far from our daily lives. ",I think everything was exhaustive.,"No, I had the impression that the format and the contents were in a good balance for the research. ",I think it did not had an effect on my annotation performance.,I think they shared a good thematic relation.,To increase the security of the platform that we use on a daily basis and to help the increment of the role of figures such as contents reviewer
I think that it was usefull to understanding the differences in thinking among various commentators in a public setting.,It was a bit difficult expecially when the comments referred to things unrelated to the event itself or brought up political or cultural issues that were not always easy to understand.,Maybe some short explanations about the meaning of the comments.,I would have avoided including ambiguous comments.,"I don't think so, I tried to respond always sincerely without being influenced.","Yes, the annotation was certainly based on personal values investigated during the questionnaire.","I would use it in case of trashing and bulliying to warn commenters that their statements could be dangerous and have consequences, without abolishing freedom of expression."
"Same as before: pointing out wrong things is a good thing to do, but it doesn't really work if polite argumentation or even (heated) criticism is trashed in favour of low-effort insults and shitstorms where the point is not discussing anymore.","The task wasn't difficult or emotionally impactful, but some comments made me indeed angry. Some comments were difficult to annotate due to a lack of proper context (lack of subject, general ambiguity), while others looked completely out of context and useless for the sake of the annotation, being targeted at different people or companies (e.g. Disney is targeted a lot of times in the Halle Bailey comments instead of the actress)","The problem could be solved by adding some options to filter the unclear comments. The lack of it risks to ""pollute"" the results of the task and therefore its usefulness",As above,I answered according to my beliefs in the most coherent way possible. So I guess I did.,"Yes, as morality is what makes us perceive things as right or wrong.","It's a very hard question: automation of recognition and subsequent action can be lackluster (many posts on social medias are nowadays mistakenly flagged or not flagged at all), but if the subsequent action is decided by a human operator, the action can be biased, as the operator will have their own morality too, perceiving things in maybe a different way.
I think no one got to give a ""correct"" answer to this question yet, and I don't think I'm the most qualified to find one "
"I don't think my opinion changed: I think it's okay to shame & cancel people for (for example) being racist, but not okay to shame them for being (for example) overweight.","I found it a bit annoying, because I found the scale ""how much does this contribute to shaming"" often not applicable for the comments in the dataset. Also, it was disturbing for me that, for example, comments shaming Lizzo for having double standarts and being a fatshamer herself, and comments shaming her for her weight sometimes got the same grades in this task. Also, I was confused with the choice of video sources: why were Fox news (pro-Trump media) and Inside Edition (quick wikipedia search gave me that it was ""classified by the Pew Research Center Project for Excellence in Journalism as ""tabloid press"" and a ""pseudo news program"""") chosen? I hope it was done to get the more conservative audience in the comments who are more likely to express shaming and write anti-woke comments and not because those sources are considered reliable.","I would add ""0"" as not applicable on the shaming scale (i.e. I remember some comment about Putin and Trump in the Halle Bailey section). Also I think it would be interesting to make a column ""how much do you agree with this comment yourself"": that would be interesting for analyzing the moral values impact on annotation, and also help to avoid feeling that if I'm marking something as shaming I disagree with it.",See above,No,"I don't perceive them that way, although they were probably supposed to be.","I don't think I would use it tbh (like for automatic removing/hiding comments), the risk of marking some normal comment as shaming is too high. I've already seen Facebook blocking people for posts that were mistakenly recognized as offensive. I think at least those decisions need a manual check first."
people are more prone to give into racist\misoginistic\etc biases  online  than they would in an irl setting ,"i wasnt really surprised\distressed by what i read. i use twitter\reddit on a daily basis, so im used to this kind of interaction among the users ", -, -,no,"they are  related, but the task we were required to perfom for each one of them was different, so i completed them bearing in mind that my personal views(=questionnaire) should be somewhat attenuated when completing the annotation ",it depends on who is the developer
"I feel like it's a powerful way to express one's emotions, yet it's usually done in a pursposefully mean or aggressive way to get a reaction out of people. Many of the commentators use the anonimity that internet provides to be hurtful, especially since the target celebrities in question feel untouchable and far away from every day reality. But if something of the sort happened to a normal, everyday person, it'd be unbearable. ",I found it difficult to be detached and objective when annotating since I feel for some of the topics discussed and it was hard not to let my own judgement take control sometimes. Some comments were difficult to read and analyze without spurring some type of emotion or reaction in me. ,"Some comments felt like they didn't really make sense with the context of the video that we had to watch - sometimes they had nothing to do with the target celebrity. I also had a comment in another language other than english and that was difficult to annotate. Also, there were some comments that referenced to known pieces of information in american culture that I didn't have any context on. ","I would have chosen comments that would have been easier to read based on their contents. Not all of them were like this, but some were actually difficult to put into place with the topic of the annotation. ","Not really, mostly beause we did fill the questionnaire in class and the annotation was done in another moment, so it felt like too much time passed for the questionnaire to actually influence the annotation. ","Thinking about it logically, I'd say that they are related, but since they were done separately (some time passed between the completion of both tasks) the questionnaire wasn't very impactful.  ","It would be great to make some comments harder to be found or read, since the internet is accessble by anybody, and it could really damage someone's mental health if not used carefully. Of course everyone has the right of free speech, but the comments that only focus on hateful words or intentions sould be monitored closely, if not ban the users or give them actual repercussions just like in real life. "
It's a problem that should be tackled with more resources related to context and psychology/ history not exclusively under a linguistic point of view,Challenging,I would have added more categories and labels among which to choose,I would have add better indications on the context. Sometimes it was difficult to understand to who precisely the comments were addressed,Sometimes it did but I managed to be objective ,Yes,"I would use it to add suggestions to the writer before the message is published, in order to re-shape the imagine they want to convey and avoid attacks to vulnerable categories. "
sometimes people use a very aggressive language in order to humilate that person and everyone / everything around the target even if it's not related,"I found it a little bit difficult in the annotian of the acceptability levels, for instance when there were swear words or if the comment was neutral (sometimes comments were not so specific)",A more detailed function for the level of acceptability,no,not so much,yes because the way we perceive a statement (if I am agree or not) can affect the opinion I have on the attitude of a specific person and so on the annotian.,I would use it to avoid cases of cyberbullying
"There are full of different attitudes and thoughts around us in this world. Sometimes people are ""barve"" when they post online but in the reality, they change back to a polite and not that hating person. ","It's not difficult in general. But for some comments, it's a little bit ambiguous to determine.",Hating speech can reflect the social pressure to some extent?,"When I annotated, I found that I may need an option that ""not-related"" for the Label 1",Yes,80%,"By analysizing the speech of internet users with the tool, we can set some basic rules for commenting to protect a better internet environment and also do some social psychology analysis based on people's inner pressure and try to get the root reason and provide more help."
it is,"it is difficult to evaluate so many comments, eventually they blurred together and rating them becomes a little bit challenging","Examples for the annotation task, a brief tutorial maybe; I would also add what to do in case the annotator does not understand the comment, its context or if the comment is blank or just filled with emojis. ","I would implement the ""neutral"" label, maybe specifying the cases in which it can be used in the guidelines; also I would enlarge the scale to rate the comments, adding values in between, because comments can be both things at the same time (for example: it can be a polite argumentation with criticism in it or a critical attack). ","Not really, I mostly forgot about it","Yes, I'd say so","Using a tool can be useful to moderate or censor hateful comments, but sometimes even those type of comments can contain some grain of truth or some insights. So, it should be done with all the care in the world, taking into account all the possibilities. I generally don't like the idea of using an automatic censor machine (if we can call it that way), even though in times like these hate spread like wildfire. Imo human moderators are still the better option, but I understand that the amounts of comments left in every piece of digital media have become impossible to evaluate manually. First and foremost we should educate the public in how to use social media and how to engage with users in a respectful way (and maybe it should be done in schools, since they are tool so pervasive in today's sociaty). Laboratory activities should be implemented to ""study"" social media usage in schools. "
It is probably one of the main issues the AI faces,I found the annotation task quite thoughtful. It made me understand where the AI could have faced some problems.  ,"There are more things than comments only. It could also be interesting to look at memes, videos and something similar ",no,not at all ,not so much. I know that they are related but the questionnaire was more general than the annotation task and sometimes it could be possible that -- in my answers -- there are some sort of mismateches I think.,to create a social media in which all the possible shames are denied for those who want to nagivate and scroll in sort of safe environment for themselves.
Very useful tool.,Difficull considering the fact that some comments referred to cultural things that people living out US do not get. Also some slang words were difficult to understand. ,Nothing to add. ,No.,No.,Yes.,To detect spam or hating troll profiles (that does social sistematically).
"After the annotation task, I realised how important the role of the community is in supporting a target celebrity, since it seems that no matter what happens, the community will always be there.",Difficult because in some cases it was necessary to research the meaning and interpretations of certain terms or expressions.,"Perhaps I would add the possibility of annoting hate speech against other people than the target celebrity, such as Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson in the task on J.K. Rowling. It would have been useful to have free notes to write down some impressions after the annotation phase. ","In general, I think it would be better to involve native speakers in annotation tasks to better understand the pragmatic and semantic intent of these subtle uses.",I don't think so,"Yes, although I found some questions in the questionnaire misleading. ","I would use it to generate awareness of the more implicit and subtle expressions used in social media shaming, for instance by emphasising offensive terms whose meaning is known only to a specific group."
I think social media shaming is a very important topic that we often underplay thinking that it cannot be too hurtful. The annotation task showed me how negative comments can encourage more negative comments from other users that feel that their opinion is validated. In fact in the annotation for each video most comments were mostly on a single side of the debate. This may implicate that people with a different opinion may feel discouraged from taking part in the discussion.,It was an interesting process that exposed me to opinions that are very different from mine and I did not think were that popular (e.g. I thought everyone agreed that JK Rowling was transphobic and that Andrew Tate was misogynistic),No,I think it may be interesting to add a questionnaire about the opinion of the annotator towards the celebrity in question after watching the video (meaning that it's taken BEFORE that annotation) and then making them take the same questionnaire after annotating all comments. The goal of this would be to understand if comments can influence the view we have of a person (or more broadly of a topic) or if we just filter out all comments because we either don't agree with them or because they are not constructive opinions.,Don't think so,Yes kind of ,Preventing online hate and the creation of bubbles
"It is not just calling out bad behaviours of people online, it escalates very quickly, becomes polarized. In some cases it became more polarized than usual, getting to verbal aggressions and bullying, for instance: Lizzo.
Users were raging against her, and I think people used her outspoken stance against body shaming as an excuse to openly bully her for her size. (funny how first insults to women are always related to appearance)
In general, this seems to reflect how ""politically correctness"" is strongly fought online since people feel like their freedom of speech is being threatened by it. 
Also, (according to my morality) people who had done far worse and spread harmful beliefs and hurt people (Tate) not only got the same (if not smaller) amount of hate as the others but received a lot more support from the community.
This makes me think that the amount of hate received (public perception) is not correlated with the severity of a person's actions. And societal biases were uncovered once again.",Reading and analysing the comments was very annoying and disappointing.,Nothing that comes to my mind right now,Nothing that comes to my mind right now,"I think it did because it gave me some time to reflect on what is ""more wrong"" and therefore ""deserved"" more hate from my point of view, and also made me realize that I did in fact have an opinion about it while I liked to think of me as impartial (I'm not). I hope it made my annotation more ""fair"" and less biased.","I think it was useful and necessary, I think that this kind of task really benefits from it.","HS detection online on social media platforms, detecting biases in journalism, television, public discourse etc"
"It is a very dangerous phenomenon. This is the first time I have deeply read comments about social media shaming, and it seems to me that people feel free to share their unfounded personal opinions without engaging in a proper information-gathering process beforehand.","I find it difficult especially  because English is not my first language. It was not emotionally impactful to me, but It was surely interesting because I read about facts that I I didn’t know before, so I was curiose to watch the video and annotate the next tab!",no,no,"don't think so, I approached the annotation and the moral questionnaire as separated tasks.",No,It would be useful to have a tool that highlights possible examples of social media shaming and reports them to users. Seeing potentially abusive content flagged might discourage people from feeling entitled to report it or answer again to the thread.
"I still think that is an alarming problem, mostly if intentionally provoked by opinion leaders and influencers.","Sometimes emotionally impactful, but mostly difficult due to the lack of a native or native-like competence in English and of a deep knowledge of many cultural references belonging to US and UK culture.",I would have liked to have the labels better explained,"No, apart from a deeper explanation of the labels",No,Somehow yes,For my digital activism and for learning objectives
"More or less same as before, comments on YouTube means pretty much nothing. Just people putting their thoughts on the web. Unless it is an organized act, when there's a person or people organizing attacks. (either on the platform or elsewhere)","The categories were difficult. Some of the comments were something out of place entirely and there wasn't a category for that. Also what the type of argumentation it is, when the commenter just straight praises the target person? It's not polite argumentation. It's like criticism or ""attack"" just from the other part of the spectrum. There wasn't an option for that.",.,.,No,"It seemed to type me, but from my side totally unrelated",To make an option for creators to automatically block comments that attack them or overtly criticize
"After completing the annotation, I see social media shaming as a highly complex phenomenon with both positive and negative aspects. On one hand, it can be a form of collective accountability, used to call out problematic behavior or raise awareness about important issues. On the other hand, it often lacks nuance and can escalate into disproportionate harassment, causing significant harm to individuals, even when their actions may not warrant such extreme reactions.","I found the annotation task challenging at times, particularly in cases where the shaming was directed towards a topic or entity rather than an individual directly. For example, when people criticized a Disney movie but not the actress explicitly, yet it was evident that their dislike for the movie stemmed from their feelings about the actress. These indirect cases required careful consideration to determine the true focus and intent of the shaming, which made the process more complex.","No, I believe the task and guidelines were comprehensive, and I did not feel the need to add anything further.","No, I found the task and its structure clear and appropriate as it was.","No, the moral questionnaire did not influence the way I performed the annotation. I approached the task objectively, focusing on the guidelines and criteria provided.","Yes, I perceived the questionnaire and the annotation as thematically related. Both focused on moral perspectives and values, which are closely tied to understanding and evaluating cases of social media shaming. The questionnaire provided a framework for reflecting on moral foundations, which aligned with the ethical and social implications explored during the annotation process.","A tool that recognizes social media shaming could be used in several impactful ways. It could help social media platforms identify and mitigate harmful behavior by flagging content that targets individuals or groups for shaming. This would create a safer online environment by reducing harassment.  The tool could also notify individuals or organizations when they are being targeted by shaming, allowing them to take proactive steps, such as reporting the content or seeking support.  And, organizations could use the tool to monitor and evaluate how online discourse affects their reputation or operations, helping them develop policies to address issues effectively.  "
"Just as I tought before the annotation, social media shaming is a full- fledged and pervasive form of violence and I feel like it is the way people express their frustration through the perception of a separate ""virtual"" world where there are no consequences to the individual actions, but in truth there are many. After the annotation I realized that I have signaled more hate comments on Instagram","I found the task difficult. At first I tought it would be easy to judge whether a comment was hateful or not, but in practice I had many issues in distinguishing and judging the sentences based on the tone, sarcasm, or any shades of spoken language or hidden aspects hard to catch in a few words comment.",Some comments were very context specific and hard to interpret even after watching the videos and in that case labeling them felt like a court judgment without enough evidence. Maybe next time it can be specified who or what they are referred to. ,"At the end I chose to label harshly all the ""borderline"" comments following the principle that hate speech has to be condemned in all its forms and AI should be educated this way. Perhaps knowing what people actually meant would make me change my opinion? ","Yes, I got further information to perform the annotation but the willingness to condemn hate speech and make AI to do so as well was preexistent ",Yes,"I would use it to mark hateful comments on social media in the first place and then make haters accountable for their actions just as it happens with crimes in ""real life"""
Perception of the relevance of this topic rose. I realized how much violent online space could be. ,"Long (it takes time); quite difficult for non native american speakers; yes, emotionally impactful ",Not always easy to annotate without more context,no,no influence perceived,"yes, definitively ",I would use it to moderate comments in the social media of my organization
"I think it is a very dangerous phenomenon. Before the annotation I already knew about this, but usually when I run into comments like those of the annotations I prefer to skip, while this work forced me to face reality and realize how those comment can be awful. ","I found it emotionally impactful because I had not just to read the comments, but reasoning about them and judging them in their impact. It was not so difficult, but I have to admit that sometimes I didn’t exactly know how to complete it, above all when I had to decide between the option bullying and attack one subject, sometimes it was difficult for me to decide the choice to select. ","Maybe an I don’t know answer, because sometimes the comments where so specific about the country, that I found it difficult to understand some of them. ",No ,No,Yes ,"to do research to show to social network, maybe hoping they will take this issue seriously and find solutions or way to handle it.  But I would use it also for private people, to help them select shaming comments easily and maybe do something about it . "
"I don't think my opinion changed after the annotation task, but it has reinforced my belief that many comments are very contextual, meaning that any individual can be perceive them as acceptable or unacceptable depending on their values and beliefs.","I'd consider it interesting, because it made me reflect on my own biases.",I would've added more context to the comments. Many of them were difficult to analyse and judge without knowing what exactly they were referring to.,Not really.,Not at all,"Yes, although I did forget that I had compiled the questionnaire while I was doing the annotation.","It could be used to analyse systematic ways in which hate speech presents itself in specific contexts. This can help to make research on hate speech to understand how it spreads, in which spaces and how it does so, in order to find a way to minimize the issue. Then, it can also be used to indicate safe spaces.
That being said, I think I might need to talk about it with other people to figure out the best ways to use it."
"It's a complex topic. Many people criticize and attack on a personal level, instead of on behavior, without respect. ","Interesting!

"I think it's a really important topic that must be addressed. The annotation tasks, in my opinion, highlights how the tone and aim of social media shaming may vary, frequently impacted by how the public views the topic, and can lead to feelings of  empathy or discomfort depending on the annotated remarks","Depending on the nature of the comments, the task could feel emotionally impactful. At tims, it was a bit difficult to place certain comments within the different levels of shame against the subject",More context about the comments or additional examples of neutral/non-shaming comments could be included to offer a balanced perspective during annotations,The Excel sheet's readability and usability could be improved by adding more understandable headers and instructions for annotators,"By increasing annotators' awareness of their moral intuitions, the questionnaire may have an impact on their assessment of the seriousness or purpose of shaming","Yes, the thematic link is evident, as both involve evaluating moral and ethical dimensions of behavior in online interactions","A tool like this could identify harmful interactions as they happen, support moderation processes, and offer valuable insights for research on online communication"
I realized that I am so accustomed to social media shaming that the annotation process turned out to be more difficult than expected because of how desensitized I have become.,"It revealed to be more challenging than expected, especially when trying to stick to a uniform metric throughout the entire annotation task",I would have liked to include a variable related to irony,"I would have made the annotation guidelines, particularly concerning the labels, clearer and more precise","Partially, yes. It prompted me to reflect on my own viewpoints and perspective, which helped me approach the annotation task with greater impartiality","Yes, although the questionnaire covered a broader and more general range of themes, I still saw it as related to the annotation","I would use a tool that recognizes social media shaming to identify harmful content and promote a safer, more respectful online environment. I don't think censorship is the right way to handle these situations, but rather spreading awareness to the general public."
I think it's very important to make youngsters aware of this topic,difficult,"no, I guess it's complete as it is",no,no,yes,to develop more researches about social media interaction
people should try to remain objective toward situations and not create hate speech and violence out of a mere desire for spectacle and participation in debate.,"I found some of the comments, the more polarized ones, difficult to annotate.

Conversely, I felt harsher toward comments that strayed from my point of view.",Have had more data and context to be able to note more accurately,More space to argue,not at all. ,yes,would be useful in drafting guidelines that media narratives should adhere to and in activating comment moderation programs 
"The annotation task reinforced the view that social media shaming is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon. It not only reflects and reinforces societal biases, but also has the potential to cause real harm by amplifying negative stereotypes and fueling online hostility","The annotation task was both challenging and thought-provoking. Ambiguous comments and subjective language required careful consideration, and the sensitive nature of topics such as hate speech and cancel culture made the task emotionally engaging as well as intellectually demanding, always trying to maintain an objective point of view ","It would have been useful to include additional examples in the annotation instructions to better handle ambiguous cases, which might improve consistency in the labeling process","A more detailed explanation of how to distinguish between similar categories—particularly in terms of the acceptability scale—could help reduce subjectivity. Also, additional training or calibration sessions with sample annotations might have minimized discrepancies","The moral questionnaire prompted a greater reflection on ethical considerations. It made it clear that personal biases and socio-demographic backgrounds might influence the interpretation of the comments, thereby urging a more cautious and reflective approach. I have tried to keep my line of thinking objective, taking into account the fact that it is probably influenced by my moral","The moral questionnaire provided a framework for understanding the ethical implications of the annotation task, making the two activities feel thematically connected by emphasizing the responsibility in handling sensitive content","A tool capable of recognizing social media shaming could be extremely valuable for automatically identifying harmful content and enabling timely interventions. It could help platforms moderate content more effectively, assist researchers in understanding patterns of online hostility, and support the development of strategies for de-escalation, ultimately contributing to a safer online environment"
